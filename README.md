# At Case Study

About You currently mainly work with an internally developed rule-based attribution model.

If a touchpoint was triggered by a digital marketing channel, we usually have this information and can attribute the corresponding share of the purchase to this channel. This information in combination with the costs for the marketing campaigns help us improve our marketing spend allocation.

One limitation of this model is that our offline marketing campaigns (e.g., TV, radio or billboard advertising) cannot easily be included (because we do not know which sessions were triggered by offline media). However, we have spotted that directly after a TV spot is aired more customers than we would expect to visit our online shop. We decided to use this signal to improve our attribution model.

## (EDA) Exploratory Data Analysis 

In this notebook I want to take a detailed look into the data sets, each column's distributions, relationships between data sets and so on.  You can start to read my home assignment from this step.

##  Data Cleaning and TV Probability Calculation
In this notebook I want to clean the data sets, create new columns to analyse tv spot interactions and calculate TV probabilities. This step is the second step of my home assignment.
